This is not a career path I ever thought I would take. I was never really interested in the tech industry and it seemed like a foreign concept to me. I went straight from high school to college in Boston to pursue my then desired dream of working in the film industry. After a few months, I realized that this was NOT the job for me; I was getting left behind in my classes and my fellow students seemed to have a better knack than I did, which was very discouraging. I came home to California lost and unsure what my future would hold. 
I started to take the safe route and enrolled in my local community college to earn credits towards a bachelors degree in Business Administration. I took my classes, not fully interested in the subject matter, but thinking this is the path I need to be on. Both of my siblings graduated college from great schools and I felt like I needed to follow in their foot steps. I got a job working for Nordstrom during school and started to take on more hours, meaning my school work feel to the wayside and I eventually stopped going all together.
It has been a little over a year since that happened and I asked myself, "What am I doing with my life?" Did I want to work in retail forever? No. Did I want to go back to school to finish my degree? Not really. I wanted to pursue something that I was actually interested in and something that I would look forward to doing everyday. 
While working at Nordstrom, I learned that an online presence was more important than ever now for the retail industry. Everything is about convenience for the consumer now; how fast can you get something, how easy is it to access that item. That's when I started looking into a career in tech and saw how easy it was to gain an education suitable enough to get a job. I knew right away that this is the career I wanted to pursue.
